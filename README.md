# Data understanding 
I will be using deepseek fr the data response f our mobile application.DeepSeek is an advanced AI language model designed for natural language processing tasks, similar to OpenAI's GPT models. It provides powerful text generation, comprehension, and conversational abilities, making it a great choice for building this AI chatbot. DeepSeek is known for its efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and ability to handle complex queries while maintaining coherence in responses. Since it supports API integration, it allows me to seamlessly connect it with my application. Using DeepSeek for this ensures a reliable and intelligent conversational experience.
